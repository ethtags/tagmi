## Open Questions
* What are the moral/ethical implications here?
* Which code should be public, which code should be private?
* What licenses should be used for which pieces of code?
* How to protect against scraping?  
* What Data Privacy Laws do we need to respect?  
* What other laws do we need to respect? PCI?  
* Moving everything on-chain and making all data publicly available -- is this feasible in today's environment? Wait for ZKRollups and cross-chain/layer communication to mature?
